# The very first version of WarOdds application

This is a pre-release version of Warlords Battle Odds Calculator for Android. The application developed by NativeScript Core technology. For calculations used Monte Carlo method with 10,000 simulations.

The application is not signed because it is developer version. Nevertheless, it is fully functional and can be used to calculate odds for the Warlords Classic battles.

**This is depricated version.**

For next version I switched to NatvieScript Vue framework and source codes of new version can be obtained in NativeScript.Vue directory.
